## Briefly About Myself:
I’m a high school student. I’ve been interested in programming, studying it for nearly 3 years. I additionally study in programming school and write usaco.org tests and try contests. I participated in two conferences with presentations about digital imaging. I’m planning to continue studying and improving my skills in this sphere. I hope to get into MIT or Stanford University to study computer science.

I also study and love playing drums. Have studied in art academy for 4 years and am still improving my art skills. Play volleyball and love sport activities. I enjoy cooking and want to study it professionally. I participate in school activities and am part of school student self-governance which is planning school activities. I also want to study writing and write a few action books. Generally, i have many interests and I try to improve in them.

I’m fast learner when it comes to things I’m interested in. I hope in future my work will be related with game development and consider my interests and additional skills.

## Code example:
**task:** Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string s
 having length 10
 made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string s
 differs from the string "codeforces".

For example string s=
 "coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in 4
 indices, shown in bold.

Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string s
 differs from "codeforces".

Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string s.

**answer in c++:** 

    main() {
 
    int t;
 
	cin >> t;
 
	while (t > 0) {
 
		string chack =  "codeforces";
  
		string input;
  
		cin >> input;
  
		int output = 0;
  
		for(int i = 0; i < input.size(); i ++) {
  
			if(input[i] != chack[i]) {
   
				output++;
    
			}
   
		}
  
		cout << output<< endl;
  
		t--;
  
	} 
 }`
